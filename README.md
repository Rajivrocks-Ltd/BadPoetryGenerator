# Bad Poetry Generator
Generating poetry using Markov Chains based on Emily Dickinson's poetry from [Gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/12242/12242-h/12242-h.htm).
Approaches like vanilla and higher order Markov chains will be explored. If time allows I will try and train an LSTM deep.
neural network to generate more coherent poetry.

This is a project for the course on Computational Creativity at the [Master's program in Computer Science at the Leiden university](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/computer-science) given by [Prof. Rob Saunders](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/medewerkers/rob-saunders#tab-1)
