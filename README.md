# Bad Poetry Generator
Generating poetry using Markov Chains based on Emily Dickinson's poetry from [Gutenburg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/12242/12242-h/12242-h.htm).
Approaches like vanilla and higher order Markov chains will be explored. If time allows I will try and train an LSTM deep
neural network to generate more coherent poetry.
